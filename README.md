Racer Game

Create a game using jQuery, in which a character is advanced across the screen on a keystroke or click, after which a winner is determined.
The page is set up abiding by separation of concerns principle, and the screen reacts to resize dynamically. It is very simply constructed.

##Installation

Created basic .html, .css, and .js files and linked them. Also linked in jQuery and bootstrap resources.

##Usage

Two players can play. One player advances character via keyboard strokes, the other via single clicks. Once they have moved across the page, an alert will declare winner.
